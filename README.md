# Sarge AI System
This is an AI system that is intended to provide instructions for running the GitHub Actions workflow. Unlike other AI systems Sarge AI designates two factions as friendly and only one faction as hostile. This approach provides a simulated pvp/pve environment that changes depending on how players react to the AI.

## Behaviour
Below are some common troubleshooting steps for the GitHub Actions workflow:

2. **Debugging Steps**
   - Check the execution and output of each step in the workflow.
   - Verify the configuration and dependencies in the workflow file.
   - Review any environment setup and build/test commands for potential issues.

3. **Common Solutions**
   - Ensure that all required dependencies are properly installed and configured.
   - Check for errors related to build, test, or deployment steps.
   - Review the workflow setup for any incorrect configurations.

After following these steps, you can address common issues encountered in the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Customizing
Almost every setting you can think of is available to be customized to each server owners liking. This includes weapons, uniforms, vests, headgear, cars, helicopters and much more. Server owners even have the option of creating their own map markers for static AI to patrol, fortify, ambush and other tactical approaches.

## Units
* Survivors
  * Fighting for survival as most of us are; These AI do not wish to start unneccessary confilict as they intend on living as much as any player. These AI will assume every player is friendly unless they are given reason to think otherwise. They often wear toned down military apparel and civilian clothing and should be easy to spot as to not frighten unaware players.

* Military
  * As the dominant force in a wasteland of fugitives and other life threatening obstacles the military takes no chance when it comes to combat. Dressed in high level miliatry apparel and the weapons to back it up these NPCs will roam about the area they spawn in and nuetralize any threat they encounter. Dont' be a threat ;)

* Bandits
  * With no apparent loyalty to anyone but the small group of others they travel with these NPCs will roam the map surviving any way they are able to. These AI will steal any loot they encounter and attempt to kill any player they encounter. Outfitted with respectable weapons and headwraps to protect their identities from the authorities these AI make for a formidable enemy. 

This description is brief but to the point. Although it may not be listed you will find these NPCs are capable of suprising things.
