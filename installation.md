Tips:
- To configure Sarge AI use the fn_preInit.sqf file inside the init folder of the sarge PBO.
- You can make groups size, type and percentage adjustments by using the *_grps_mapName.sqf file inside the code\map_config folder.

### Step 1
Package and/or place the sarge PBO inside the @epochhive\addons folder.

### Step 2
Place the files that are in epoch.Map inside of your mission folder and repack.

### Step 3
Start the server and check your log to see if Sarge AI is loading properly.
